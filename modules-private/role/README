Roles are a collection of profile inclusions that build up all the services
required for a particular node to perform its duties. They are the highest level
of abstraction, describing a machine's role in terms appropriate for its
business role. Classes at this level should contain minimal references to any
specific technology or service, and should map 1:1 against an individual node.

You should not have a memcached role, for example - a CacheServer role would be
better, and it could call a memcached or AppCache profile which selected the
memcached module to install.

Limiting roles to one per machine helps avoid class-already-defined errors in
Puppet, and allows easy visibility into everything a particular machine is
running. If you have a machine that runs lots of different services, it would be
immediately apparant by the large number of applied profiles in its role manifest.

Again, Roles should be entirely specified in terms native to the business and
the particular machines that host services.
