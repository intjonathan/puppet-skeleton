Profiles are where to translate the business notion of a server role into a
collection of technologies and configuration values that allow that machine to
fill its role.

Profiles should be the layer where you interact with Hiera or other
configuration sources, call underlying community- and internally-created
technology-specific modules, and assemble the components to run a service.
Profiles should be independent, but you may create hierarchies using include if
you have multiple services that are exceedingly similar.

Modules they call should be portable and avoid dependencies on other modules -
the profile for the application or service should orchestrate those
dependencies. This way we can contain our external module dependencies to one
layer.

Profiles can be somewhat large, and contain lots of glue code to allow a module
to work the context of a particular infrastructure. This is fine, as it allows
the modules themselves to be as portable as possible.
