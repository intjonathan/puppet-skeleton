Modules that are not called 'role' or 'profile' should perform a technology-
oriented task and have minimal dependencies on other modules. They should expose
an API entirely sufficient to configure the technology in a puppet-friendly and
portable way. They should also be built in such a way that other organizations
with different infrastructures could benefit from them with minimal changes.

They should receive all their configuration via parameters or well-documented
facts. They should have no silently-discovered configuration other than osfamily,
and conventions should be overridable by passing overridden default parameters
or facts.
